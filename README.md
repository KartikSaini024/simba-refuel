## Notes on Email Sending

### Testing Emails Locally

In `src/components/EmailReportSender.tsx`, there is a comment showing how to switch the API endpoint to your local Express server for testing email sending before deploying to Vercel.  

- By default, the frontend calls the serverless function at `/api/sendReportEmail`.
- To test with your local server (e.g., `http://localhost:5000/api/sendReportEmail`), uncomment or modify the fetch URL in `handleSendEmail` accordingly.
- Make sure your local server (`server.js`) is also running ('node server.js' in cmd line) and the environment variables (`GMAIL_USER` and `GMAIL_PASS`) are set in your `.env` file.
